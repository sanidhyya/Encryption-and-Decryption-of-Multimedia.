# Encryption-and-Decryption-of-Multimedia.
The encryption and decryption of numerous multimedia files is the basis for our comparison of the AES and blowfish algorithms. We will perform analysis based on various performance attributes.In the end we will determine the best choice for multimedia encryption and decryption using the results of this analysis performed.
